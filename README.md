# Secure File Access System

This is a Python-based simulation of an operating system-style secure file access system. It was designed to demonstrate key cybersecurity and OS-level principles such as user authentication, role-based access control, secure file handling, logging, and file-level encryption.

Built with a focus on **learning and simulation**, this project offers a safe, GUI-based environment to explore how secure file systems operate ‚Äî and how they might be attacked or protected.

## Features

- **User Authentication**
  - Login and registration system with SHA-256 password hashing
  - User roles: Admin and Standard User

- **Access Control**
  - Role-based file permissions
  - File access limited by user ownership and role

- **File Operations**
  - File creation, viewing, deletion
  - XOR-based encryption for confidentiality
  - Automatic file directory setup

- **Logging**
  - All user actions are timestamped and logged
  - Admin can view and clear logs

- **GUI (Tkinter)**
  - Simple desktop interface to manage all actions
  - No terminal commands required

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-file-access-system.git
cd secure-file-access-system
```

### 2. Run the Project

Make sure you're inside the `src/` directory:

```bash
cd src
python gui.py
```

If your system uses `python3`:

```bash
python3 gui.py
```

> The GUI should launch automatically. All necessary folders and files will be created at runtime.

## üõ† Dependencies

No third-party libraries required ‚Äî everything uses Python‚Äôs standard library:

- `tkinter` ‚Äì GUI
- `hashlib` ‚Äì Password hashing
- `json` ‚Äì User storage
- `os`, `datetime`, `getpass`, etc.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can change the default data directory:

- By default, encrypted files are saved in a `data/` folder.
- To change this, edit the `DATA_FOLDER` variable in `files.py`.

---

## Notes

- This project is **for educational and simulation purposes** only.
- User credentials and logs are stored in plain JSON and text files.
- The encryption method (XOR) is intentionally simple for learning purposes.
- Logs and user data are auto-generated during usage.

---

## Learning Objectives

This project is part of a broader personal learning path focused on:

- Understanding OS-level access control concepts
- Simulating real-world file system security problems
- Practicing secure coding and interface design
- Building tools as a future penetration tester and cybersecurity specialist
